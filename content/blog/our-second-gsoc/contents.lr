GSoC in a nutshell: Google grants stipends to students that work with open source organizations. This helps the projects (new developers, code and ideas) as well as the students (prepare for employment, enjoy free and open source software environment) -- it is a great opportunity!

If you are interested in working with us this summer, make sure to:
* Check our [ideas page](https://web.archive.org/web/20120524091509/http://wiki.unknown-horizons.org/w/Ideas_2012).
* Join us on [IRC](https://web.archive.org/web/20120524091509/http://www.unknown-horizons.org/support/irc/) to get to know our team and further discuss your ideas.
* Start communicating early, applications close on April 6th.
After outlining your first basic concept and discussing it with the would-be mentors and our community, you create a user page in our wiki where you explain your proposal in detail. We will then polish it together, where possible. This of course means that applications reaching us very late will receive less attention; you certainly have better chances of being accepted if we already know you a little and saw that you are familiar with our codebase ;-)

Feel free to attend to our [weekly meeting](https://web.archive.org/web/20120524091509/http://wiki.unknown-horizons.org/w/Next_meeting) tomorrow (or any other Sunday) at 17:00 UTC .
Not sure what UTC is? Check your time difference [here](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20120318T17)!

Kind regards and looking forward to your application!
Your **Unknown Horizons Team**.
