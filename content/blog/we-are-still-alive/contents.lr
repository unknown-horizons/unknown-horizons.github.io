We have started with porting the game to Godot Engine.
We have an new Project Leader for the Godot Version. And he is hard working to get the game playable again.
We get too help from other developers. But progress is at the moment slow.
I hope that we can release an playable version in 2021. Sorry that you guys must wait that long.
But it will worth it :)
