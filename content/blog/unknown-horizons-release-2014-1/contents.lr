All in all, the new release **Unknown Horizons 2014.1** provides a more stable gaming experience with new content and a bit of eye candy added as well.
As some of you may have noticed already, there are several big changes happening around our engine FIFE right now. As a result of this, some new features (like the color overlays spotlighted above) are only available after a new engine release, or if you're running a development snapshot. There is more work ahead to fully adopt our code to more of those changes, like replacing the currently used [guichan library](https://code.google.com/p/guichan/) with its FIFE-maintained improved fork [fifechan](https://github.com/fifengine/fifechan). Look forward to advanced text styling, many new cool widgets (e.g. for in-game statistics) and full UTF-8 support!
