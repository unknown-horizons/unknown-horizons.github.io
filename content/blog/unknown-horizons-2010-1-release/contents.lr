## Multiplayer
Our biggest feature is the new multi-player mode. It allows you to play with **Unknown Horizons** players from around the globe. Please be aware that the new multi-player mode is still quite unstable. If you are having trouble connecting to the other players, please visit our [IRC](http://web.archive.org/web/20160330061156/http://www.unknown-horizons.org/support/irc/) channel. We will then try to find a solution and  document it.

## Tutorial
Our new tutorial is quite long and goes into a lot of details of the game. It is especially interesting for new players but even players of the former **Unknown Horizons** versions will find new information in the tutorial. We have created a framework on which we hope to create a campaign some time in the future. The main tutorial writer eoc has made a big effort in bringing you this nice scenario, so be sure to take a look!

## Performance
Performance has been a big issue for **Unknown Horizons** since the beginning. The FIFE team worked very hard to speed up the rendering. The Result is a FPS rate which is 50-100% faster for most players. Of course we at **Unknown Horizons** also optimized our code in the hope for a more responsive game and improved a lot of core algorithms. We are not where we want to be, but we're getting there.

## Translations
A lot of work has been put into the translation of **Unknown Horizons**. We are happy to present full translations into: German, French, Italian, Norwegian and Estonian. Plus some translations in good progress: Polish, Portuguese and Spanish. We can also present a full translation of the tutorial in German thanks to ottk3, who translated it within a day. If you would like to help with the translation of **Unknown Horizons** into your native language, be sure to checkout our [Pootle server](http://web.archive.org/web/20160330061156/http://pootle.unknown-horizons.org/).

## Help Wanted
We are looking for help in all areas, but we have a special need for new graphics. We need graphics for new buildings to allow us to implement further settler levels. All help is welcome, no matter if you want to help with game design, translations, graphics or programming.
