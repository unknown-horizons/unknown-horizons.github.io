We are happy to announce that the Server move that produced some errors, downtimes and various other problems in the past few days is finally done.

Of course there are some little cosmetical things that still need some  work but the biggest things are done. We wish you all much fun at exploring the World of Unknown Horizons and are happy to see you soon (maybe at our IRC channel ;)).

Greetings<br>
