    <h2>The idea of Unknown Horizons</h2>
    <p>Our intention is to create an open source real-time economy simulation game with strategy elements in an isometric 2D engine.</p>
<p>Unknown Horizons is based upon the Flexible Isometric Free Engine (or in short: <a href="http://fifengine.net/">FIFE</a>). We work closely with the FIFE developers to integrate new features we developed for Unknown Horizons, but could be also useful for other games as well.</p>
<p>We are trying to create this game in our free time and just for fun.</p>

Your inhabitants will see various different increments on their way to wealthy tradesmen  and each increment will bring up new demands and desires of your people. Take care about their needs, taxes are a linchpin of sucess in Unknown Horizons.</p>
<p>Sooner or later you will have established a bright and big town. Other settlers in this new world will accompany and observe your progress.
